## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model using a RandomForestClassifier to predict whether an application will be approved or declined. The model was trained, tuned, and evaluated using various performance metrics to ensure high accuracy and reliability.

---

## Data Preparation and Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning**: Missing values were handled using `SimpleImputer` with the most frequent value strategy.
- **Feature Encoding**: Categorical features were label-encoded to convert them into numerical format.
- **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
- **Data Splitting**: The data was split into training and validation sets in an 80-20 ratio for model evaluation.

---

## Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning

- **Model Used**: `RandomForestClassifier`
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid Search Cross-Validation (GridSearchCV) was used to optimize the model’s hyperparameters:
  - `max_depth`
  - `max_features`
  - `min_samples_leaf`
  - `min_samples_split`
  - `n_estimators`
  
- **Best Hyperparameters**:
  - `bootstrap`: False
  - `max_depth`: 20
  - `max_features`: `sqrt`
  - `min_samples_leaf`: 2
  - `min_samples_split`: 5
  - `n_estimators`: 300

## Model Performance

The performance of the model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: 89.1%
- **Precision**:
  - Approved: 0.90
  - Declined: 0.87
- **Recall**:
  - Approved: 0.94
  - Declined: 0.79
- **F1-Score**:
  - Approved: 0.92
  - Declined: 0.83
- **ROC AUC Score**: 0.959

These metrics demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict application status, with significant improvements after hyperparameter tuning.

---

## Insights and Conclusions

- **Model Performance**: The model achieved an accuracy of 89.1% and an ROC AUC score of 0.959, indicating its reliability.
- **Feature Importance**: The model's precision and recall, especially for the `Declined` class, improved significantly after tuning.
- **Generalization Capability**: The model is well-suited for generalization, reducing the risk of overfitting.

---

## Test Predictions

The final model predictions were saved in a CSV file named `predictions.csv`, containing the following columns:

- **UID**: The unique identifier from the test set.
- **Prediction**: The model’s prediction for each UID.
